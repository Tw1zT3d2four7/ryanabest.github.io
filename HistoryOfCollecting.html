    <p>How has the The Metropolitan Museum of Art's <a href = "https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection">collection</a> evolved throughout it's illustrious history? Where are their artifacts and artworks from, and when did they acquire pieces from which areas of the world?</p>
    <p>As a student of Data Visualization at The Parsons School of Design, I was tasked with conducting a quantitative visualization that focused on The Metropolitan Museum of Art's collection, who partnered with our studio course for the semester. I was floored by the both the breadth and depth of the museum's collection, which numbers in the hundreds of thousands of pieces that span over 5,000 years of human history. I wanted to look at the entirety of this collection to explore where these pieces came from and how the museum's collection patterns had evolved in almost a century and a half of history.</p>
