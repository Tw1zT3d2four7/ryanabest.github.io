    <h1>The Migration of Art</h1>
    <p>This desktop prototype explores how we can visualize an artwork's travels across the globe through ownership changes and exhibition displays, focusing on <a href='https://www.metmuseum.org/'>The Met's</a> collection of Van Gogh paintings.</p>

    <h1>The Project</h1>
    <p>How does art travel across the globe before it arrives in a museum gallery? When was it bought and sold, and by whom? When and where was it sent on exhibition tours? Studying an artwork's rich history of movement is crucial to understanding how the world interacted with this piece, along with how it influenced the broader world of art and human culture.
    While a student of data visualization at Parsons School of Design, I worked with wonderful partners at <a href='https://www.metmuseum.org/'>The Metropolitan Museum of Art</a> to explore answering these questions in a visual context, utilizing both an abstracted visual timeline and animated mapping to follow the museum's collection of paintings by Vincent Van Gogh through their paths of movement from creation to their current location at The Met.</p>

      <b>Data Source:</b> The Met API, made available to our course.
      <br>
      <b>Tools: </b>
      Python and <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">pandas</a> for data collecting, cleaning, and aggregating.
      <a href="https://d3js.org/">d3</a>, <a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">node.js</a> for web development and prototyping.

    <h1>Visual Design</h1>
    <p>The Migration of Art starts with a full-screen animation showing each painting included in the project moving across the screen, orienting the user to the project's concept of watching these pieces move from place to place, along with a short introduction reminscient of a placard next to each painting on the walls of a museum.</p>
    <p>Early iterations of the visual representation of each painting's history of movement centered around a map, animating each leg of the painting's journey to different cities and countries. This visual then evoled to focus primarily on an abstract representation of this movement. This abstract timeline charts a painting's migration to each location it visited along the y-axis, which includes a mark for each location visited by any painting in this project, arranged from east (top) to west (bottom). Along the x-axis, we maintain a visual representation of each year within this history of movement, allowing us to see the painting's full path traveled in one visual.</p>
    <p>The map view is maintained but pushed to the background, allowing for the user to watch an animation of the full path traveled from artwork creation through 2017 once they navigate to this view.</p>
