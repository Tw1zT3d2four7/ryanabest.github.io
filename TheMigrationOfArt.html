    <!-- <h1>The Project</h1> -->
    <p>How does art travel across the globe before it arrives in a museum gallery? When was it bought and sold, and by whom? When and where was it sent on exhibition tours? Studying an artwork's rich history of movement is crucial to understanding how the world interacted with a piece, along with how it influenced the broader world of art and human culture. While a student of data visualization at Parsons School of Design, I worked with wonderful partners at The Metropolitan Museum of Art to explore these questions in a visual context, utilizing both an abstracted visual timeline and animated mapping to follow the museum's collection of Van Gogh paintings through their paths traveled from creation to their current location at The Met.</p>

    <h1>Process</h1>
    <p>
      <b>Data Source:</b> The Met API, made available to our course.
      <br>
      <b>Tools: </b>
      Python and <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">pandas</a> for collecting, cleaning, and aggregating data.
      <a href="https://d3js.org/">d3.js</a>, <a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">node.js</a> for web development.
      Sketch and Adobe Illustrator for concept development and visual prototyping.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class = "project-content">
    <h1>Data</h1>
    <p>The main data challenge in this project was how to parse ownership and exhibition histories, which are organized as separate paragraphs of text and lists in the Met's API and front-end webpage, into workable structures that brought these data together into one cohesive story of movement for each painting.</p>
    <p>After bringing down each provenance paragraph and exhibition history from The Met's API into static files, I needed to split the paragraphs of provenance text into individual unique ownership tenures, associating each owner the with the location listed and timeframe of ownership. I then joined exhibitions and provenance together into the same timeline, logging the location of a painting in each year from creation through 2017 (the most recent data available). In my model, a painting moves locations any time it was acquired by a new owner or went on exhibition. After a painting's last exhibition, it returns to The Met. I used pandas for this data processing and aggregating into data frames, which I then exported as JSON files to be loaded into my front-end visualization.</p>

    <h1>Visualization</h1>
  </div>

  <!-- Travel Timeline  -->
  <div class = "project-image">
    <img src = "../assets/projects/MigrationOfArt/TravelTimeline.png"/>
  </div>
  <div class = "project-content">
    <p>Our main visualization focuses on an abstract representation of each painting's movement. Each location visited by at least one painting in our analysis gets a horizontal line on our y-axis, arranged from east (top) to west (bottom). These locations range from cities to specific Museums. Along the x-axis we track each year in the painting's lifespan, allowing us to see the painting's full history of movement in one visual.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Travel Map  -->
  <div class = "project-image">
    <img src = "../assets/projects/MigrationOfArt/TravelMap.png"/>
  </div>
  <div class = "project-content">
    <p>This abstract timeline is supported by our map view, showing the path each painting traveled across the globe from its creation through 2017. Through animation we can walk through each year of this journey, following along with these travels in real time.</p>

    <p>For users that may be interested in a broader context on the inspiration and impetus of this project, we can see more information in this tertiary level of detail, reminscient of a placard next to each painting on the walls of a museum.</p>

    <p>We welcome our users with a friendly animation that both draws in our users with an engaging visual, while also orienting us to the project's concept of exploring how these pieces move from place to place. These paintings will also become the menu with which we navigate and filter the project's main visualizations, while a concise introduction orients us to the context and importance of the project.</p>

    <h1>Mobile</h1>
    <p>Finally, we were tasked with presenting our project in a 'new context', designing a consistent visual either in the mobile or physical space. The following mock-up displays how we could interact with The Migration of Art on a mobile device, adapting this interface and visualization to a more constrained screen with a wholly different method of interaction.</p>
