    <h1>The Migration of Art</h1>
    <p>This visualization explores how artwork travels across the globe through ownership changes and exhibitions, focusing on <a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/">The Met's</a> collection of Van Gogh paintings.</p>

    <p>How does art travel across the globe before it arrives in a museum gallery? When was it bought and sold, and by whom? When and where was it sent on exhibition tours?</p><p>Studying an artwork's rich history of movement is crucial to understanding how the world interacted with a piece, along with how it influenced the broader world of art and human culture. While a student of data visualization at Parsons School of Design, I worked with wonderful partners at The Metropolitan Museum of Art to explore these questions in a visual context, utilizing both an abstracted visual timeline and animated mapping to follow the museum's collection of Van Gogh paintings through their paths traveled from creation to their current location at The Met.</p>

    <p>The main data challenge in this project was how to parse ownership and exhibition histories, which are organized as separate paragraphs of text and lists in the Met's API and front-end webpage, into workable structures that brought these data together into one cohesive story of movement for each painting.</p>
    <p>After bringing down each provenance paragraph and exhibition history from The Met's API into static files, I needed to split the paragraphs of provenance text into individual unique ownership tenures, associating each owner with the location listed and their timeframe of ownership. I then joined exhibitions and provenance together into the same timeline, logging the location of a painting in each year from creation through 2017 (the most recent data available). In my model, a painting moves locations any time it was acquired by a new owner or went on exhibition. After a painting's last exhibition, it returns to The Met. I used pandas for this data processing and aggregating into data frames, which I then exported as JSON files to be loaded into my front-end visualization.</p>

  <!-- Travel Timeline  -->
  <div class="project-image">

  </div>
  <div class="project-content">
    <p>Our main visualization needed to contain layered and rich information, maintaining the entire history of each painting's movement while distinguishing ownership changes and exhibitions, in a concise and aesthetically beautiful visual. My solution for this challenge was this abstract travel timeline, inspired by E.J. Marey's 1885 graphical <a href="https://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0003zP">train schedule.</a></p>
    <p>This visualization, and the corresponding axes themselves, tell a detailed story about the collection. Each location visited by at least one painting in our analysis gets a horizontal line on our y-axis, arranged from east (top) to west (bottom), allowing us to get a relative sense of where this collection as a whole traveled - and where it didn't.
      Our x-axis starts when the first painting in our collection was created, in 1885, through to our most recent data in 2017, allowing us to track where this piece traveled during each year in the painting's lifespan in the context of the collection as a whole. These axes stay consistent for each painting, allowing for quick and easy comparisons across the different paintings in our study.</p>

    <p>On a mobile device, I needed to adapt this interface and visualization to a more constrained screen which requires wholly different methods of interaction. The orientation of our main visualization and painting menu are rotated to better utilize scrolling. A collapsable menu allows our users to determine the level of detail available at each data point while they scroll, along with changing which visuals are shown. Additional project information and visual legends are also accessible behind this menu.</p>
